# üåæ AgriGenius: Crop Recommendation & Yield Prediction System

An end-to-end data science project that recommends the best crop to grow based on soil and weather conditions and predicts the potential crop yield. Built with Python, Scikit-learn, and deployed as an interactive web application using Streamlit.

## üöÄ Live Demo

You can access and interact with the live application here: **[AgriGenius App]([YOUR-STREAMLIT-APP-URL-HERE])**

## ‚ú® Features

* **Crop Recommendation:** Recommends the optimal crop based on real-time input of soil nutrients (Nitrogen, Phosphorus, Potassium) and atmospheric conditions (Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall, pH).
* **Yield Prediction:** Predicts the expected crop yield (in tons per hectare) based on the state, season, crop, and year.
* **User-Friendly Interface:** A clean and simple web interface built with Streamlit for easy interaction.



## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

* **Backend & Machine Learning:** Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Joblib
* **Frontend:** Streamlit
* **Deployment:** GitHub, Streamlit Community Cloud
